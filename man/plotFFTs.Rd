\usage{
plotFFTs(
  data,
  tagging.dates,
  type = "detections",
  axis.periods = c(48, 24, 12, 8, 6),
  id.col = "ID",
  min.days = 10,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing binned animal detections (must contain a "timebin" column).}

\item{tagging.dates}{A POSIXct vector containing the tag/release date of each animal.}

\item{type}{Type of response used to calculate FFTs. One of  "detections" or "presences".
Presences are estimated by time bin (0 - 1), independently of the number of detections.}

\item{axis.periods}{Periods (in hours) to display below the plots.}

\item{id.col}{Name of the column containing animal IDs. Defaults to 'ID'.}

\item{min.days}{Discard individuals that were detected in less than x days.}

\item{detrend}{Detrend time series using differences (\code{\link[base]{diff}})
rather than the actual detections.}

\item{cols}{Number of columns in the final panel (passed to the mfrow argument).}

\item{same.scale}{Forces same spectral scale (ylims) across all plots,
allowing for density comparison between individuals. If set to false, all y-axis are displayed.
Otherwise they are only displayed in the left-most plots to save space.}

\item{id.groups}{Optional. A list containing ID groups, used to
visually aggregate animals belonging to the same class (e.g. different species).}

\description{
Function that analyzes and plots periodic patterns in detections using a
FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) framework. By decomposing data series into the
frequency domain, FFT allows the identification of dominant spectral peaks
that may reflect, for example, tidal (6 hâ€“12 h) or diel (24 h) cyclic patterns in habitat use.
